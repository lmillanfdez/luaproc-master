*** ISSUES ***

Using luaproc together with luasocket can result in segmentation faults.
Apparently that is caused neither by bugs in luaproc, nor in luasocket, but
rather by the concurrent execution of some glibc functions that are called by
Lua when these libraries are used. Since the Lua interpreter binary is not
linked to pthreads, memory management is not handled properly by glibc and leads
to corruption.
 
There are at least two possible workarounds:

1 - Pre-load (LD_PRELOAD) pthreads when executing the Lua interpreter to run the
script that uses luaproc and luasocket. 

2 - Compile a Lua interpreter binary that is linked to pthreads.

In particular, we observed this issue is likely to happen when the getaddrinfo
glibc function is called from luasocket functions being executed within Lua
processes. Hence, another possible workaround would be to not resolve hostnames
within Lua processes but rather (a) use IP addresses or (b) have the main Lua
script resolve hostnames and send the corresponding IP addresses to Lua
processes via message passing.
